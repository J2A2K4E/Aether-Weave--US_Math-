Aether Weave is a challenge to build an immersive, interactive 3D art installation where users navigate through a vast, evolving volumetric nebula. The nebulaâ€™s density, color, and flow are procedurally generated using complex fractal plaid patterns, evoking a sense of infinite, interwoven cosmic fabric.

Key Features:

Real-time Volumetric Raymarching: Implement advanced raymarching techniques in GLSL for intricate light scattering and absorption effects within the dynamic nebula.
Fractal Plaid Modulation: Use multiple layers of animated fractal noise to modulate the nebula's properties (density, emission, color), evolving over time to resemble a plaid pattern.
Interactive Navigation & Control: Allow users to freely "fly" through the nebula with intuitive mouse/keyboard controls. Enable real-time adjustments of plaid scale, animation speed, and color palettes via a user interface for personalized exploration.
Audio-Reactive Flow: Make the nebula's internal currents and animation speed react to ambient sound input (e.g., microphone or background music) using the Web Audio API, adding a dynamic synesthetic layer to the experience.
